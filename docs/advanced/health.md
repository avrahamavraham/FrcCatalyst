## Overview

Catalyst v0.3.3 ships a built-in fault layer. Every Catalyst mechanism
registers a small set of `HealthCheck`s in its constructor — over-current,
high-temperature, over-temperature cutoff, stall, not-zeroed, low-pressure
— and `HealthMonitor` evaluates them once per loop.

You don't need to write any wiring. Declare the mechanism, deploy, and
firing checks show up in three places:

1. **NetworkTables**, under `/Catalyst/Health/<subsystem>/<id>/...` — so any
   dashboard can subscribe.
2. **The Health Dashboard** at `docs/tools/health/index.html` — single-file
   web viewer with severity-colored cards and filters.
3. **The existing `AlertManager`** — so dashboards already wired against
   `/Catalyst/Alerts/...` keep working unchanged.

Teams add their own checks in one fluent call.

## The standard motor checks

Every motor-driven mechanism gets these for free:

| ID | Severity | Fires when | Debounce | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `OverCurrent` | WARN | stator current > 90% of configured limit | 0.5 s | log + NT |
| `HighTemp` | WARN | motor temp > configured warn threshold | 1.0 s | log + NT |
| `OverTemp` | ERROR | motor temp > warn + 10 °C | immediate | **calls `motor.stop()`** |

Multi-motor mechanisms (Flywheel secondary, Winch second, Claw follower,
DifferentialWrist left/right) register the same checks per motor with
collision-free id suffixes — `OverCurrentSec`, `HighTempLeft`, etc.

Mechanism-specific checks layered on top:

- `LinearMechanism` + `RotationalMechanism`: `Stall` (WARN) and `NotZeroed` (INFO).
- `FlywheelMechanism`: `NotSpinningUp` (WARN) — non-zero setpoint but no velocity.
- `PneumaticMechanism`: `LowPressure` (WARN) when a compressor is wired and
  `requirePressureAbove(psi)` is configured. Below the threshold the mechanism
  also **refuses to actuate forward** to avoid firing a piston dry.

## What gets published

For each registered check:

```
/Catalyst/Health/<subsystem>/<id>/firing       boolean
/Catalyst/Health/<subsystem>/<id>/severity     string (INFO|WARN|ERROR)
/Catalyst/Health/<subsystem>/<id>/description  string (static)
/Catalyst/Health/<subsystem>/<id>/detail       string (live — e.g. "92 C")
/Catalyst/Health/<subsystem>/<id>/firedAt      double (FPGA timestamp)
```

Plus a rollup at the top of `/Catalyst/Health/`:

```
ErrorCount, WarnCount, InfoCount   integer
Healthy                            boolean (true iff zero errors and zero warns)
```

## Adding your own check

A check has a name, severity, predicate, optional live detail string, and
debounce/clear timing. Register it once at construction time — typically
in the subsystem that owns the sensor:

```java
HealthCheck.builder("Climber", "RopeSlack")
    .severity(HealthCheck.Severity.WARN)
    .description("Climber rope slack detected")
    .when(() -> ropeTensionSensor.getNewtons() < 5)
    .detail(() -> String.format("%.0f N", ropeTensionSensor.getNewtons()))
    .debounce(0.5)      // must stay below 5N for 0.5s before firing
    .clearAfter(2.0)    // must stay above 5N for 2s to clear
    .onFire(() -> driver.rumble(0.5))
    .onClear(() -> driver.rumble(0))
    .register();
```

The predicate runs every loop. Buggy lambdas don't take down the monitor
— exceptions are caught and the check is treated as "not firing" for that
tick.

## Workflow

1. **At robot init**, Catalyst's built-in mechanisms register their checks.
   Anything you add fires off in your subsystem constructors.
2. **Each loop**, `HealthMonitor.update()` is called by every mechanism's
   `updateTelemetry()`. It's throttled to a 5 ms minimum so all eight
   mechanisms calling it cost one evaluation per scheduler tick.
3. **On a fire/clear edge**, NT entries update, `AlertManager` is poked,
   and `onFire` / `onClear` hooks run.
4. **Open the Health Dashboard** during practice/test to see what's hot.
   In a match, the same data is on whatever NT dashboard your team uses.

## Cross-mechanism safety: `RobotSafety` (v0.3.5+)

`HealthMonitor` reports per-check state; `RobotSafety` is the higher-level
watchdog that decides "the robot has too many simultaneous faults — stop
doing things." It's opt-in: when not configured, it adds zero overhead.

```java
public void robotInit() {
    RobotSafety.configure(
        RobotSafety.Config.builder()
            .maxConcurrentErrors(2)   // trip when 2+ ERROR checks fire at once
            .debounce(0.25)           // ...sustained for at least 0.25 s
            .onTrip(() -> {
                drive.stop();
                superstructure.stow();
                leds.fire();
            })
            .build());
}
```

Then read the signal from anywhere. The shorthand `trippedTrigger()`
helper (added in v0.3.5.1) returns a WPILib `Trigger` ready for
binding:

```java
// Idiomatic — bind directly in configureBindings():
RobotSafety.trippedTrigger().onTrue(drive.stopCommand());

// Or check the flag manually inside any subsystem:
if (RobotSafety.isTripped()) { /* ... */ }
```

The watchdog publishes to `/Catalyst/Safety/{Tripped,Reason,ErrorCount,WarnCount}`
so the Health Dashboard and any other NT viewer light up when it fires.
Call `RobotSafety.reset()` to manually clear once you've intervened, or
configure `.autoReset(seconds)` to clear automatically once the underlying
checks have stayed clear.

The library never forcibly disables motors itself — the trip is advisory.
Each team decides what "all-stop" means for their robot.

## Event history: `HealthHistory` (v0.3.5.1+)

Beyond the live state, Catalyst keeps a ring buffer of recent fire / clear
edges. The buffer holds the last 100 events by default and is fed
automatically by `HealthMonitor` — no extra wiring needed.

```java
// Newest event first. Each Event has a timestamp, subsystem, id,
// severity, kind (FIRED / CLEARED), and the live detail string from
// the moment of transition.
for (HealthHistory.Event e : HealthHistory.snapshot()) {
    System.out.println(e);
}

// Bigger buffer for a long elimination match.
HealthHistory.setCapacity(250);

// Reset between matches (mostly useful in unit tests).
HealthHistory.clear();
```

The buffer also publishes to `/Catalyst/Health/History` as a string array
(pipe-delimited fields). The Health Dashboard surfaces this as the
"recent events" timeline so anyone in the pit can see what went hot
five seconds ago.

The serialization format is intentionally simple — `timestamp|kind|severity|subsystem|id|detail`
per entry — so a small script can ingest it for post-match triage.

## Severity rules of thumb

- **ERROR** → something is broken or about to be broken. The robot should
  stop the affected mechanism (use `onFire(motor::stop)` like the built-in
  `OverTemp` check does).
- **WARN** → degraded but operational. Driver should know, but the
  mechanism still runs.
- **INFO** → notable but expected. The default `NotZeroed` check is INFO
  because it's normal until the team zeroes the mechanism.

## Disabling specific checks

There's no global mute, by design — you shouldn't ship a robot to a
match with checks turned off. If you really need to suppress one in
sim, gate the registration:

```java
if (!Robot.isSimulation()) {
    HealthCheck.builder(...).register();
}
```

## Performance

Each `HealthCheck.evaluate()` runs the predicate once, optionally formats
a detail string, and updates two timestamps. No allocations on the steady
path. With eight built-in mechanisms × ~3 checks each = 24 evaluations per
loop, plus whatever teams add. At 50 Hz this is well under 1 ms total even
on a roboRIO 2.
